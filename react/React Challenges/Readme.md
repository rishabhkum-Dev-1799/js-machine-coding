## Problem Statement

Imagine you have a large dataset (e.g., a list of articles) that you want to display on a web page. To improve the user experience, you want to implement an infinite scroll feature. This means that as the user scrolls down the page, more data should be loaded and displayed without the need for manual pagination or clicking a "Load More" button.

Your task is to create a React component or application that accomplishes the following:

1. Display an initial set of data items (e.g., articles).
2. As the user scrolls down the page, load and append more data items to the list dynamically.

Feel free to use any libraries or tools you find necessary to complete this task.
